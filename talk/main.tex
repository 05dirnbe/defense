	 \item $\textbf{1}^{S}_{T} \cdot x(0) \ge \textbf{1}^{T}_{0} \cdot x(0) = 1 $
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{block}

	


	\begin{alertblock}{\underline{Lemma:} }
	An equilibrium point of the evolution equation is a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{E}$ such that $\dot x = 0$. By assumption there are a finite
        number of such points. Every equilibrium point corresponds to a distinct s-t path and vice versa.

	\begin{alertblock}{\underline{Theorem:} Convergence for the continuous model:}
	  As $x(t)$ approaches a stationary point $\eta(t)$ goes to the length of the corresponding shortest path.
	\end{alertblock}

	The proofs for the discretized version follow a similar approach, except the development of $V(t)$ and $\eta(t)$ is tracked in discrete

	\begin{alertblock}{\underline{Theorem:} Convergence for the discrete model:}

%    \frametitle{Improvements}
% 
%     \underline{Basic idea:} The more balanced and flat the trees are, the more efficient FIND($x$) operates on them.
% 
%     \underline{Heuristics:}
%     \begin{itemize}
%      \item UNION by rank: Lower ranked trees are merged into higher ranked trees.
% % 	  
% % 	  \begin{itemize}
% % 	    \item Rank is unchanged or increased by at most 1.
% % 	    \item Reduces the time FIND takes to return the root-node.
% % 	  \end{itemize}
% 
%      \item Path-compression: All child-nodes traversed by FIND($x$) are redirected to point at the root-node.
% 
% % 	\begin{itemize}
% % 	 \item Reduces the time FIND will take in subsequent calls.
% % 	\end{itemize}
% 
%     \end{itemize}
% 
%     \underline{Amortized costs:}
%     \begin{itemize}
%      \item FIND($x$): $\mathcal{O}( \ln n) $.
%      \item UNION($x,y$): $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
% 
%     \end{itemize}
% 
%   Equipped with these heuristics UNION-FIND takes an amortized $\mathcal{O}(t \, \alpha(t,m))$, which is considered optimal.

% 
% \begin{frame}
%     \frametitle{Correctness of the PTAS} 
% 
% %     The correctness of the PTAS relies on the following theorem.
% 
%     \begin{block}{Structure Theorem}
%      Given an $(a, b)$-shifted dissection,
%      there exists a $(1 + \frac{1}{c})$-approximate 
%      salesman tour with a probability of at least $1/2$, if it crosses the boundary of each square in the shifted quadtree at most $2$ times and does so 
%       always at portals.
% 
%     \end{block}
% 
%     The proof of the Structure Theorem is intricate, but the basic ingredients 
%     follow from the truth of the following statements:
%     
%     \begin{itemize}
%      \item It is not too expensive to ``bend'' the optimal tour into a portal-respecting tour (Portal-respecting Lemma).
%      \item It is not too expensive to convert a portal-respecting tour into an $2$-light portal respecting tour (Patching Lemma).

% 	  \emph{Pro features:}
% 	  \begin{itemize}
% 	   \item Can be combined with recent ``branch-and-cut'' methods to boost performance.
% 	   \item Can be parallelized.
% 	  \end{itemize}
% 
% 
% 	  \emph{Contra features:}
% 	  \begin{itemize}
% 	   \item Cannot compete with other heuristics for large problem instances.
% 	   \item Runtime depends exponentially on $c$ even in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
% 	  \end{itemize}

% \begin{frame}
%     \frametitle{Summary} 
% 
%     \begin{block}{Central ideas of Arora's PTAS}
%      \begin{itemize}
%       \item Map the given problem instance to a coarser instance, depending on the error parameter.
%       \item Apply some kind of geometric partition to subdivide the problem.
%       \item Apply suitable restrictions and exploit the partition to rephrase the problem as a family of near-independent subproblems.
%       \item Obtain an approximate solution by means of dynamic programming, combining sub-solutions in a ``divide and conquer''
%       fashion.
%      \end{itemize}
% 
%     \end{block}
% 
% %  The design of almost all known FPTAS’s and PTAS’s is based on the idea
% % of trading accuracy for running time – the given problem instance is mapped
% % to a coarser instance, depending on the error parameter ε, which is solved
% % optimally by a dynamic programming approach. The latter ends up being an
% % exhaustive search of polynomially many diﬀerent possibilities (for instance,
% % for knapsack, this involves computing A(i, p) for all i and p). In most such
% % algorithms, the running time is prohibitive even for reasonable n and ε. Fur-
% % ther, if the algorithm had to resort to exhaustive search, does the problem
% % really oﬀer “footholds” to home in on a solution eﬃciently? Is an FPTAS or
% % PTAS the best one can hope for for an NP-hard problem? Clearly, the issue
% % is complex and there is no straightforward answer.
