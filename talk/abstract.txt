title: Physarum Computing: Slime On Shortest Paths

abstract: The true slime mold Physarum Polycephalum is an interesting example of a biological system performing natural optimization. 
Wet lab experiments have shown that this extraordinary unicellular organism, despite 
lacking any form of brain or nervous system, is capable of solving various complex problems 
using its highly optimized and decentralized foraging strategy. 

In this talk I will introduce you to the world of slime molds and demonstrate what it is that they do best. I will
show you how to exploit Physarum's efficiency in order to solve the well-known shortest-path problem. 
Within a dynamical model based on a simple feed-back mechanism I present a proof that the slime will always converge to an optimal path.
